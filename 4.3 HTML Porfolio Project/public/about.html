<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Amalia!</p>
<p>I am currently employed as an international customer support specialist for an e-commerce from China with a multinational 
  clientele; more precisely, I work as a real-time chat after-sales and logistic representative for a US-based market. In addition, I 
  deal with clients from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. I have strong competency in details and communicate fluently in 
  English, both passive and active, which is shown by my educational background and my work experiences</p>
