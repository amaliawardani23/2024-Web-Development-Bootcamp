<h1>The Favorite Meal According to Amalia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 meals of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sunny Side Up Egg</h3>
<p>This is my first favorite meal. It is easy to store and prepare, cheap, high in macro and micro nutrient.</p>
<h3>Avocado</h3>
<p>This is my second favorite meal. Even the price is quite expensive but
    its taste is so yummy and do not need to take extra effort to cook it</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>I really like to eat fried chicken crispy. It is crunchy, salty, and umami.
    It is my option when I am bored to eat sunny side up egg or avocado.</p>
